# Prediction Models on Scholarship Grant by identfying the Financial Status
Creating Prediction Models to detect the student's financial status, thereby deciding whether the student should be eligible to be granted a scholarship or not.

<i>
This data is about survey crowdsourced from the parents regarding their childrenâ€™s educational conduct Venezuela and its states.
Based on the dataset given, we have attempted to Predict whether a particular student should be granted a scholarship after examining his/her financial status.

<br>
For predicting whether a student should be granted a Scholarship, we have created two models using: <br>
&emsp;  1. A Neural Network with 2 Hidden Layers & an Output Layer. <br>
&emsp;  2. Logistic Regression Algorithm
<br><br>
Extra Algos used for Cross Checking the Prediction Accuracy:
<br>&emsp;   (1) Support Vector Machine
<br>&emsp;   (2) Random Forest
<br>&emsp;   (3) XGBoost
